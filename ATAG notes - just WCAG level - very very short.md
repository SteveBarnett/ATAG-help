# ATAG notes - just WCAG level - very very short

## Part A: Make the authoring tool user interface accessible

- If the authoring tool contains web-based user interfaces, then those web-based user interfaces meet the WCAG 2.0 success criteria.

## Part B: Support the production of accessible content

- The authoring tool does not automatically generate web content after the end of an authoring session, or, authors can specify that the content be accessible.
- If the authoring tool automatically generates web content, the content is accessible or the author is prompted to make it accessible.
- If the authoring tool provides transformations, accessibility information is preserved in the output or authors are warned.
- If the authoring tool supports copy and paste of structured content, then any accessibility information is preserved.
- The authoring tool does not prevent accessible content being made.
- If there's a choice of actions, then options that will result in accessible web content are at least as prominent as options that will not.
- If the authoring tool provides mechanisms to set web content properties (e.g. attribute values), then mechanisms are also provided to set web content properties related to accessibility information.
- If the authoring tool provides functionality for adding non-text content, then authors are able to enter text alternatives.
- If the authoring tool provides templates, then there are accessible template options for a range of template uses.
- !!! If the authoring tool provides authors with the ability to add or modify web content in such a way that a WCAG 2.0 success criterion can be violated, then accessibility checking for that success criterion is provided (e.g. an HTML authoring tool that inserts images should check for alternative text; a video authoring tool with the ability to edit text tracks should check for captions). (instructions for manual checking are the minimum requirement)
- If checking can detect that a WCAG 2.0 success criterion is not met, then repair suggestion(s) are provided. (instructions for manual repair are the minimum requirement)
- A range of examples in the documentation (e.g. markup, screen shots of WYSIWYG editing-views) demonstrate accessible authoring practices. e.g. Reference examples are accessible, Screen shots show accessibility features in use
