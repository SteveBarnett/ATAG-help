# ATAG notes - just Level AA - very very short

## Part A: Make the authoring tool user interface accessible

-

- Any editing-view text formatting properties can be programmatically determined.
- Any editing-view that exposes markup is selectable and can be navigated / searched.
- Any editing-view of text-based content has a tex search, such that: all text content is searchable (including alternative content); matching results can be presented to authors and given focus; authors are informed when no results are found; and the search can be made forwards or backwards.
- The authoring tool includes mechanisms to make keyboard access more efficient than sequential keyboard access, e.g. WAI-ARIA landmarks.
- If the authoring tool includes display and/or control settings, then these settings can be saved between authoring sessions.
- The authoring tool respects changes in platform display and control settings.
- For each authoring tool feature use of the feature is explained in the documentation or the UI.

## Part B: Support the production of accessible content

- If the authoring tool provides templates, then there are accessible template options for a range of template uses and the distinctions between the accessible and non-accessible options are shown, including marking new templates.
- If the authoring tool provides pre-authored content, then a range of accessible pre-authored content (to WCAG Level AA) options are provided and the distinctions between the accessible and non-accessible options are shown.
- If the authoring tool provides checks then authors can receive an accessibility status report in some format, and programmatically associates the results with the web content that was checked.
- The authoring tool does not include the option to turn off its accessible content support features or, if these features can be turned off, authors are informed that this may increase the risk of content accessibility problems.
- All accessible content support features are at least as prominent as features related to either invalid markup, syntax errors, spelling errors or grammar errors.
